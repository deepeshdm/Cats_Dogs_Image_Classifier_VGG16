# Cats_Dogs_Image_Classifier_VGG16
A Convolutional Neural Network architecture (VG166) trained on 8000 images to classify Images of Cats &amp; Dogs.

Accuracy on validation dataset :- 97.5%

Dataset Link :- https://www.kaggle.com/chetankv/dogs-cats-images

Here we are using Transfer Learning & fine tunning the pre-trained model.We go about freezing the convolutional layers & training only the final Dense layers of the model.
